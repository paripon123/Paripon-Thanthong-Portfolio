  My Name is Paripon Thanthong, a graduate student at DePaul University in Data Science. I'm passionated about the what can we do from the insight we can ghather from the data and coding in general.

### Project 1 : NYC Real Estate Price Prediction
  [Project Link](https://github.com/paripon123/NYC-Real-Estate-price-prediction)
  - Overview
    In this project, the goal is to implement a model for predicting the price of real estate in New York City by apply multiple machine learning methods and discovery of an insight information of real estate market trend to predict sale value in the future.

### Project 2 : Credit Card Fraud Detection
  [Project Link](https://github.com/paripon123/Frauds-Detection-Project)
  - Overview
    In this project, the goal is to apply machine learning techniques on a predictive model to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
    
### Project 3 : Movie Recommender System (Class Project / Team)
  [Project Link](https://github.com/paripon123/DSC-478/blob/master/FinalProject_MLmodels%20(1).ipynb)
  - Overview
    This project showcases the findings from a movie recommender system built as part of the final project for DSC478. Initially, the user is shown the top 50 movies based on the IMDB weighted score and IMDB popularity. The user picks 5 movies that they have seen before and rates them out of 10. The recommender system is built using these algorithms: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Singular Value Decomposition, Cosine Similarity and K nearest Neighbors. It then performs bagging based on majority vote to find the best movie recommendations based on the different results from the various algorithms. The algorithm then returns the top 10 movie picks for the user. The various algorithms and their recommendations are then evaluated.

### Project 4 : Airbnb Data Analysis (Class Project)
   [Project Link](https://github.com/paripon123/DSC-540/blob/master/Final%20Project%20540.ipynb)
  - Overview
    The goal in this project is to classify and predict availability of the listing room specifically in New York City areas including all five neighborhoods which may potentially help travelers finding the right area to rent on Airbnb. In this research, multiple machine learning algorithms are applied including decision tree (QUILAN, J.R. (1986)), random forest (Breiman, L.,2001) and boosting for both regression and classification to compare results. Wrapper feature selection is also applied throughout the research to find the best set of the model. As a result, both regression and classification show low accuracy around 30% and high error which I conclude that this approach and method I used, may not bring up the suitable model to predict or classify accurately.
